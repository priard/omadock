// Pure helpers for how big a dock mark is and how much room it needs
// (components/DockIndicatorRow.qml, components/DockIndicator.qml and
// components/DockLabel.qml). Plain JS with no Qt globals, so the node tests run
// it in a vm context like DockLabels.js: the callers pass Style.space as
// `space` (the same way they pass a measuring function to DockLabels) and the
// output's pixel grid as `dpr`.
//
// One owner, because the same numbers are drawn in three places: the row sizes
// the cell each mark sits in, the indicator draws the dot and the bar, and a
// plate reserves the column's room before the icon or after the name. Spelled
// out in each file, changing one silently disagreed with the others - the same
// family as the row that declared a grid slot it did not draw.
//
// The room a mark gets is the mark: `cell` is the widest of the marks the row
// draws (the dot and the bar, each already carrying the hairline floor), so a
// theme that makes the spacing scale very compact can shrink a mark and its
// cell together, but never the cell alone. The floor itself has one owner,
// `hairline`, and every mark that is drawn applies it.

// Style.space units. The dock's classic marks: a 5 px dot (4 px when the marks
// are dense under the icon; a side column keeps 5), a 12x4 accent bar (9x4
// dense) and 3 px between marks (2 px dense).
