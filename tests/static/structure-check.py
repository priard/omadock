"""Maintainability structure check (AGENTS.md "Maintainability Rules").

Rules enforced:
  1. File-size cap: every .qml/.js/.mjs file is at most MAX_LINES lines.
  2. Composition roots (Dock.qml, DockModel.js) are the only exceptions and
     carry ratchet ceilings: they may shrink over time, never grow. Lowering
     a ceiling is part of any refactor that moves code out of a root.
  3. components/logic/*.qml are pure logic: QtObject with functions only -
     no timers, processes, file views, windows, or visual items.
  4. components/logic/*.qml functions take the owner root as the FIRST
     parameter (`root`), keeping every module call uniform.

Exit codes: 0 = all rules hold; 1 = violations (printed one per line).
