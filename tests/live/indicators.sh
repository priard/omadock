# Live: the running marks sit dead-centre on the icon they belong to, in every
# shape the row takes - the accent bar of the focused window, the dots beside
# it, the "+N" overflow pill past five windows, and the upright column that
# side indicators draw on a label plate.
#
# The marks are read as ink from a screenshot of the dock, so what is asserted
# is the row that is actually drawn, not the source that draws it: renaming a
# property or rewriting the row's layout passes as long as the marks stay
# centred, and a row that declares a slot it does not draw fails. That spare
# slot is the bug this guards - a Qt Grid reserves a gap for every slot it
# declares, so the row's empty eighth slot left a lone accent bar 2 px off the
# icon it belongs to.
#
# It opens its own windows with a terminal emulator this desktop is not already
# running (so it knows how many marks to expect) and gives the dock a flat
# opaque background for the run: behind a translucent one the wallpaper's
# texture is indistinguishable from ink. omadock.json, the windows it opened
# and the focus are all put back on exit.
#
# Keep the pointer off the item being measured: hovering scales it and lifts its
# label, and the marks move with the icon.
#
# Exit: 0 the marks are centred; 1 the dock did not answer, or a mark is
# off-centre / the row drew the wrong count; 2 nothing was measured, because
# there was no terminal emulator left to open a window with. Never 0 without
# measuring: a skip that exits 0 is a guard that cannot fail.
