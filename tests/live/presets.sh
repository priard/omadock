# Live (NON-INTRUSIVE): the preset surface, end to end, on a second Quickshell
# instance running this working tree's DockHost.qml (see tests/live/probe.sh).
#
# This is the safe live test: it never touches the desktop, the config or the
# shell the owner is using. The probe runs against a copy of omadock.json under
# a redirected HOME, hidden behind autohide with exclusiveZone 0, and the
# owner's md5 and shell PID are re-checked at exit. Use it instead of driving
# the running dock for anything the second instance can exercise - with
# QS_DISABLE_FILE_WATCHER=1 the running dock executes the code it loaded, so a
# test against it would exercise the previous release, not this tree.
#
# Covers: presets() shape (one row per name, at most one active, every saved
# preset listed, no name carried by a shipped look and a saved preset at once),
# the probe's own dock answering state/itemGeometry, applyPreset by NAME for
# shipped looks - the two name looks included, asserting their label keys reach
# the config - the id-is-not-a-name trap, deletePreset ok/not found with the
# config rewrite, save-then-remove leaving every other preset and config key
# intact, a hostile preset name stored bounded (MAX_PRESET_NAME) and stripped
# of control and bidi characters, an edit made outside the dock still being
# picked up, and no config parse failure in the dock's log (a read that caught
# the file mid-write used to hand the dock a truncated document, which it
# answered with defaults).
