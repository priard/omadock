// The looks OmaDock offers out of the box, beside the presets a user saves.
//
// A shipped preset is a preset as DockModel keeps one -- an id, a name and a
// look -- except that its look lists only the keys that differ from
// DockModel.DEFAULT_LOOK: merge() fills the rest from DEFAULT_LOOK through the
// caller's fill (DockModel.pickLook), so a look key added after this file was
// written gets its default instead of leaking whatever the dock happens to
// hold (the rule PR #48 pinned for saved presets).
//
// Shipping them here, not in the config, is what makes them survive: a fresh
// install has no omadock.json, and merge([], ...) still returns every entry
// below. They are read-only -- DockConfigLogic refuses to rename, update or
// delete one -- so the list a user edits is always the list they saved.
// merge() is also the one place a name is settled: a saved preset that holds a
// shipped look's name is listed instead of it, never beside it.
//
// Every look below is built from options this repository's pull requests
// contributed, and from what their authors said they look like:
//
//   thepathless:ristretto  the owner's own look on the maintainer's desktop
//                          (dot-matrix icons, forest gradient, grain, long
//                          custom dividers, glitch hover, no rim or shadow)
//   Glass                  gradient fill (PR #13, 7ab8e81) with film grain
//                          (#13, 172407b) and a rim that stays visible over it
//                          (#45, a9fe92c), long theme-coloured dividers
//                          (#17, bbd672b) and the Lift hover (#19, 8f46e06)
//   Pixel                  the pixel icon style with a B/W tint and a coarse
//                          grid, plus the tone controls that keep a poster-like
//                          icon readable (#13, ef69eb5 and 9e34022)
//   Mono                   the transparent dock -- icons only, no card, border
//                          or panel (#12, 23ab907) -- in monochrome with the
//                          accent tint (#13) and the Glow hover (#19, fb70a80)
//                          that was drawn for exactly these glyph-like icons
//   Panels                 Split sections (#14, afb82a6 and b721251): one panel
//                          per dock section over a quiet Mono gradient, with the
//                          panel gap #13 taught to snap to the pixel grid
//   Nameplates             names always on, joined to the icon by a Plate, with
//                          the window marks in the upright column beside the
//                          name (#47, @priard)
//   Silkscreen              the same names in the Silkscreen pixel font the
//                          labels ship with, small on a pill, drawn with the
//                          outline that reads on any fill (#47, @priard)
//
// Deliberately not shipped as presets, and why:
//   - panel layout (#49) is not a look key -- `LOOK_KEYS` has no `layout`, so a
//     preset cannot hold it and one would silently do nothing. It is a
//     placement setting, reachable from any look.
//   - #13's "Zen / Arc-style gradient" has no matching gradient: `Dock.qml`'s
//     `gradientPresets` are the fixed palette (aurora, sunset, ocean, forest,
//     rose, lavender, ember, citrus, mono) plus the theme.
//   - Wave magnification and launch bounce (#2) are motion, not a look.
// The label keys are a look's: `DockModel.LOOK_KEYS` carries all thirteen and
// `DockConfigLogic.applyLook` applies them through `DockLabels.pickLabelLook`,
// so names are exactly as shippable as a gradient is.
